This is a write up article of the program of my undergraduate thesis with the title "Multipath Routing with Load Balancing with OpenFlow Software-Defined Networking", using [this source code in Github](https://github.com/wildan2711/multipath/blob/master/ryu_multipath.py).
### Background
Multipath routing is a routing method which finds multiple routes to a destination in a network topology. By providing multiple routes to a destination, it is possible for network traffic to be distributed fairly through multiple paths in the network, or a mechanism known as load-balancing, thus increasing the efficiency of network utility.

        text: `MQTT is one of the popular data communication or messaging protocols that are becoming widely used for machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, or the computer network trend that is popularly coined as "Internet of Things". MQTT (Message Queue Transport Telemetry) is a messaging protocol with a publish-subscribe pattern, one of the messaging protocol regarded as "light-weight", which is important for the Internet of Things architecture, because it heavily involves low-powered devices, such as sensor nodes, microcontrollers, and the like.`
